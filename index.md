### ARJUN BADWAL'S FIRST CS193 HOMEWORK
#It's all caps cause I'm excited

- It looks like it'll be fun
- :tada:No midterms:tada:
- Only one lecture to attend 	<sub>Don't worry, I'll still say hi in PSO's cuz it'll be fun.</sub>
- ***COOL GITHUB THINGS***

The rest of this page feels empty, so I'm just gonna add some fun color stuff and cats.
